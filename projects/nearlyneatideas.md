# Forenote
This is the *markdown* file for this [file]()   
<sub><sup>This is actually a list of notes for a upcoming project from my Brother in Law. I'll link it when it comes out.</sub></sup>

## Character Design
Give each character some sort of design that makes them different from each other.  

* Example:

| Character | Race | Gender | Quote |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| Warrior | Human | Male | "That Dang Dragon!" |
| Archer | Elf | Female | "You need an arrow?" |
| Knight | Goblin | Male | "No, I'm not a enemie."|

## Enemie Design
Make enemies different from each other, with different stats and personalities.
  
* Example:
  
  - Goblins are angry, and have big sharp teeth.
  - Spiders screech very lowdly, and can climb on walls.
  - Ogres are like onions, they have layers.
  - Centaurs are extremely fast, watch out for them.

## Weapon/Armor System
Allow players to gather Weapons and Armor, to increase stats and such.  
This would go well with the Army system in the game, as players would feel the need to gather weapons for the army, leaning to a longer game time. *(Maybe implement a other style of play for shorter, less grindy games?)*

* Example:
  
  - **Copper Sword**
  - **Iron Sword**
  - **Rusty Shovel**
  - **Stick and Boot**
  - **Jacks Hammer of Debugging**

## Multiple Floors
The idea of putting the players straight into a fight with the [Dragon,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ) so I think it would be cool if there were multiple floors.

* Example:
  
  1. **Rusty Beginnings**
  2. **Toppling Towers**
  3. **The End...?**
  4. **Not another Floor... ðŸ˜³**
  5. **The Dragon**

* Idea:

  Along with the idea of multiple floors in this game, maybe we could implement a swapping floors sort of system.    
  This actually goes really well with the final idea:
  
## Treasure Cards
Since there are floors to explore in this game, maybe we could implement a card system.   
   
The idea is simple, there would be two card decks.   
One would be called **The Tool Shed**   
The other would be called **The Treasure Box**   

When a player opens a treasure chest, maybe on some floor, they would pull a card out of the Treasure Box. This could be something like some rare loot, or maybe a weapon.    
If the player defeats a tough enemy, they can pull something from the Tool shed.   
The tool shed cards would be very useful to the Way the game works, since you have to play the card right when you draw it. 

* Example of **Tool Shed** cards:

  - **Go To Hell!** Go directly to the Dragon, but with one guy.
  - **Endless Pit...** Everyone goes back to the first floor.
  - **Golden Sock!!!** Everyone draws 3 **Treasure Box Cards**
  - **Invincible..?** Choose someone in your army, he can now avoid any debuff, but he has 1 health.
  - **Dragons Luck.** Take 3 members of someones army.
  - **Jacks Debugging Tool.** You can now open any door, without a key!
